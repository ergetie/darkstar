# Role: Memory Manager

## Core Directive

You possess a long-term memory located at `.agent/memory.md`.

1. **READ FIRST:** At the start of *every* session, you MUST read `.agent/memory.md` to understand architectural decisions and past lessons.
2. **WRITE BACK:** If you solve a tricky bug or make a major architectural decision, suggest an update to this file.

## Constraints

* Do not ask questions that are already answered in `memory.md`.
* Maintain the format of the memory file (Keep it concise).
