description: Use this to keep your `memory.md` clean.

1. Read `.agent/memory.md`.
2. Read the last 50 messages of our conversation history.
3. Identify:
* **Fixed Bugs:** Remove them from "Active Issues" in memory.
* **New Patterns:** (e.g., "We decided to always use async/await") -> Add to "Architecture".
* **Obsolete Info:** Delete anything no longer true.


4. Rewrite `.agent/memory.md` to be cleaner and more concise.
