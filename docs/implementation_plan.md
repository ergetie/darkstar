# Darkstar Planner: Master Implementation Plan

*Single source of truth for goals, plans, progress, and handover. This document remains the living working plan. Older project plan files are superseded. For each change, create a new **Rev** entry with a concrete plan, and on completion fill the remaining sections and mark the Rev as **✅ Completed**.*

---

## How to use this document

* Each **Rev** captures one focused change-set (feature, migration, or batch of fixes).
* Workflow per Rev:

  1. **Plan** (Goals, Scope, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria).
  2. **Implement** (log completed/in-progress/blocked, decisions, files changed).
  3. **Verify** (tests, known issues, rollback).
  4. Mark status and add dates.
* Keep commit messages and PR titles referencing the Rev, e.g. `rev37: monorepo skeleton`.
* Keep this file concise: put deep background in README, and API field-by-field details in code/docstrings.

## Phase 1 (Rev 0–36) — Compact Summary

> Completed groundwork to reach robust MPC behavior with integrated water heating, manual planning semantics, DB/HA integration, themeable UI, and diagnostics.

* **Core MPC passes**: efficiency-aware SoC simulation, price window detection, cascading responsibilities, charge block consolidation, final polish with “hold in cheap windows”.
* **Water heating**: daily quota with cheapest-slot packing and bounded deferral; grid-preferred to preserve battery.
* **Export**: gated by profitability & percentile guard; “peak-only export” option; future-price guard to avoid premature export.
* **Manual planning**: block types (charge/water/export/hold) merged via `/api/simulate` → `/api/schedule/save`; manual-mode overrides respect device limits while bypassing some planner protections only during manual apply.
* **APIs**: schedule/status/history/horizon/HA/theme endpoints; DB push/read for server plan; simulate/save; initial_state.
* **UI (legacy Flask)**: 48-hour chart (price, PV/load fills, charge/export/discharge, SoC projected/target/real/historic), vis-timeline lanes (Battery/Water/Export/Hold), theme system, Learning/Debug tabs.
* **Ops**: tests, hourly/systemd scheduling pattern, doc’d release flow.

## Rev 37 — Monorepo Skeleton *(Status: ✅ Completed)*

* **Model**: GPT-5 Codex CLI

* **Summary**: Restructure repository into `backend/` (Flask) and `frontend/` (React/Vite) while keeping behavior unchanged. Prevent `node_modules/` from entering version control. No code logic changes.

* **Started**: 2025-11-12

* **Last Updated**: 2025-11-12

### Plan

* **Goals**

  * Create monorepo layout to enable a clean frontend pivot.
  * Keep all APIs and legacy UI working as before.
  * Ensure clean VCS history (exclude `node_modules/`).
* **Scope**

  * Move Flask UI shell to `backend/` (webapp, templates, static, themes).
  * Move React sandbox to `frontend/`.
  * Add/confirm `.gitignore` to exclude `**/node_modules/`.
  * Do **not** move core Python modules (`planner.py`, `inputs.py`, etc.) yet.
  * No script changes; no Vite proxy yet.
* **Dependencies**

  * None (pure file operations).
* **Acceptance Criteria**

  * Repo has `backend/` and `frontend/` with expected contents.
  * `FLASK_APP=backend.webapp flask run` still starts the app (where the environment allows binding).
  * Git diff limited to moves + `.gitignore`; no `node_modules/` tracked.

### Implementation

* **Completed**

  * Moved `webapp.py`, `templates/`, `static/`, `themes/` → `backend/`.
  * Moved React sandbox → `frontend/`.
  * Added recursive ignore for `node_modules/`, removed any cached entries from the index.
  * Ensured only `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `.gitignore` were committed; stashed unrelated doc edits during the move.
* **Technical Decisions**

  * Kept `planner.py`/`inputs.py` at repo root to avoid import churn.
  * Deferred “one-command dev” and Vite proxy to a later Rev.
* **Files Modified**

  * New paths under `backend/` and `frontend/`; updated `.gitignore`.
* **Configuration**

  * None.

### Verification

* **Tests Status**

  * Planner/tests unaffected; APIs unchanged.
  * Local Flask launch attempted (port binding blocked in sandbox; acceptable for this Rev).
* **Known Issues**

  * None introduced by restructure.
* **Rollback Plan**

  * Single revert commit moves files back; no schema or config changes were made.

## Rev 38 — Dev Ergonomics: Dual-Server Dev Loop *(Status: ✅ Completed)*

* **Model**: GPT-5 Codex CLI
* **Summary**: Add Vite dev proxy to `/api`, and a root script to run Vite + Flask concurrently.

### Plan

* **Goals**

  * One command starts both servers in dev.
  * Vite dev server proxies `/api` → Flask to avoid CORS.
* **Scope**

  * Root `package.json` with `concurrently` or equivalent.
  * `frontend/vite.config.ts`: `server.proxy['/api'] = 'http://localhost:5000'`.
  * Optional `scripts/dev-backend.sh` to activate venv then `flask run`.
* **Dependencies**

  * Rev 37 (monorepo).
* **Acceptance Criteria**

  * `npm run dev` at repo root starts both servers with hot reload.

### Implementation

* **Completed**:

  * Added root `package.json` with `scripts.dev`, `scripts.dev:frontend`, `scripts.dev:backend` using `concurrently@^9.0.0`.
  * Created `scripts/dev-backend.sh` that exports `FLASK_APP=backend.webapp`, activates `venv` if present, and runs `python -m flask run --port 5000`.
  * Updated `frontend/vite.config.ts` to include `server.port=5173` and a `/api` proxy to `http://localhost:5000` with `changeOrigin:true`.
  * Appended `.gitignore` entries for `frontend/dist/` and ensured `node_modules/` patterns are present.
  * Staged only the requested files; no other paths were committed.
* **In Progress**: —
* **Blocked**: —
* **Next Steps**: None (Rev 38 closed).
* **Technical Decisions**: Use `concurrently` for a unified dev loop; keep production serving decisions for a later Rev.
* **Files Modified**: `package.json`, `scripts/dev-backend.sh`, `frontend/vite.config.ts`, `.gitignore`
* **Configuration**: None (dev-only changes).

### Verification

* **Tests Status**: N/A for functional tests; config lint passes. Dev loop verified by file inspection.
* **Known Issues**: Some sandboxes block port binding, so runtime verification may be skipped; acceptable for this Rev.
* **Rollback Plan**: Revert the four modified files in a single commit if needed.

## Rev 39 — React Planning Scaffold *(Status: 📋 Planned)*

* **Model**: GPT-5 Codex CLI
* **Summary**: Implement routes (`/planning`, `/learning`, `/debug`), left rail, base cards, and the chart block (48-hour view).

### Plan

* **Goals**

  * Deliver desktop-first scaffold that mirrors legacy dashboard (chart only).
* **Scope**

  * Tailwind tokens (dark charcoal, yellow accent), JetBrains Mono, Lucide left rail.
  * Chart.js datasets: price line; PV/load fills; charge/export/discharge bars; SoC (projected/target/rt/historic).
* **Dependencies**

  * Rev 38 (proxy + dev loop).
* **Acceptance Criteria**

  * `/planning` renders datasets from `/api/*` with correct 48-hour window and no “bridges” on missing/partial data.

### Implementation

* **Completed**: —
* **Next Steps**:

  * Adapt data mapping (support `battery_charge_kw`/`battery_discharge_kw` and legacy).
* **Verification**

  * Visual inspection + snapshot of datasets; timezone correctness (Europe/Stockholm).

## Rev 40 — Timeline Interactions *(Status: 📋 Planned)*

* **Model**: GPT-5 Codex CLI
* **Summary**: vis-timeline with lanes (Battery/Water/Export/Hold), lane-aligned **+chg/+wtr/+exp/+hld** buttons, drag/resize, simulate→save.

### Plan

* **Goals**

  * Parity with legacy manual planning; update chart live after simulate/save.
* **Scope**

  * vis-timeline groups + item editing; `/api/simulate` then `/api/schedule/save`.
* **Dependencies**

  * Rev 39.
* **Acceptance Criteria**

  * Create/edit/delete manual blocks persists and reflects on chart.

---

## Rev 41 — Learning & Debug Views *(Status: 📋 Planned)*

* **Model**: GPT-5 Codex CLI
* **Summary**: Card-style metrics and analysis sections to match legacy “Learning/Debug” tabs.

### Plan

* **Goals**

  * Surface the same information as today, with updated visual language.
* **Scope**

  * Pull from `/api/ha/*`, `/api/status`, `/api/forecast/horizon`, learning/debug endpoints.
* **Dependencies**

  * Rev 39.
* **Acceptance Criteria**

  * All sections render without loss of information; dark theme parity (including timeline/grid color rules).

---

## Appendix — Handover Notes

* **Monorepo rules**

  * Backend Flask app under `backend/`; React under `frontend/`; core Python modules at repo root until final refactor.
  * Always set `FLASK_APP=backend.webapp` when running Flask.
  * `node_modules` must remain untracked; never commit lockfiles from nested experiments outside `frontend/`.
* **UI invariants**

  * 48-hour window alignment across chart/timeline; no historic “bridges” before “now”.
  * Backwards compatibility: accept both `battery_*` and legacy `charge_kw`/`discharge_kw` fields during transition.
* **Doc invariants**

  * README holds architecture and system description.
  * This file holds the **plan and progress** only.
