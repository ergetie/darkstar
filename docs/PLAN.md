# Darkstar Energy Manager: Master Plan

**Vision: From Calculator to Agent**
Darkstar is transitioning from a deterministic optimizer (v1) to an intelligent energy agent (v2). It does not just optimize based on static config; it observes context (Weather, Vacation, Prices), predicts outcomes (Aurora ML), and actively strategizes (Strategy Engine) to maximize efficiency and comfort.

### Rev 63 — Export What-If Simulator (Lab Prototype)

**Goal:** Provide a deterministic, planner-consistent way to answer “what if we export X kWh at tomorrow’s price peak?” so users can see the net SEK impact before changing arbitrage settings.

**Scope:**
*   Add a debug tool (`debug/test_export_scenarios.py`) that:
    *   Runs the current HeliosPlanner schedule once to establish a baseline.
    *   Uses the existing deterministic simulator (from `learning.py`) to compute full-horizon cashflow metrics (grid import cost, export revenue, battery wear) for baseline vs scenarios.
    *   For each scenario, injects a manual “Export” block at the highest-price future slot using the same path as `/api/simulate` (`prepare_df` → `apply_manual_plan` → `simulate_schedule`) and re-evaluates the resulting schedule.
    *   Reports total SEK delta (baseline vs scenario) plus exported energy and any safety violations, suitable for future Lab UI integration.
*   Keep planner core logic untouched; reuse the existing `DeterministicSimulator._evaluate_schedule` cost model so the what-if analysis stays aligned with Learning and avoids duplicating cashflow logic.

**Next:** Once validated via CLI, wire this into the Lab tab as an “Export What-If” card so users can visually compare scenarios before relaxing protective export guards.

### Rev XX - PUT THE NEXT REVISION ABOVE THIS LINE!

## Backlog

### 🧠 Strategy & Aurora (AI)
*   **[Rev A25] Manual Plan Simulate Regression**: Verify if manual block additions in the Planning Tab still work correctly with the new `simulate` signature (Strategy engine injection).
*   **[Rev A27] Scheduled Retraining**: Automate `ml/train.py` execution (e.g., weekly) to keep Aurora models fresh without manual intervention. Similar to Rev 57!
*   **[Rev A28] The Analyst (Expansion)**: Add "Grid Peak Shaving" capability—detect monthly peaks and force-discharge battery to cap grid import fees.
*   **[Rev A29] Smart EV Integration**: Prioritize home battery vs. EV charging based on "Departure Time" (requires new inputs).

### 🖥️ UI & Dashboard
*   **[UI] Reset Learning**: Add "Reset Learning for Today" button to Settings/Debug to clear cached S-index/metrics without using CLI.
*   **[UI] Chart Polish**:
    *   Render `soc_target` as a step-line series.
    *   Add zoom support (wheel/controls).
    *   Offset tooltips to avoid covering data points.
    *   Ensure price series includes full 24h history even if schedule is partial.
*   **[UI] Mobile**: Improve mobile responsiveness for Planning Timeline and Settings.

### ⚙️ Planner & Core
*   **[Core] Dynamic Window Expansion (Smart Thresholds)**: *Note: Rev 20 in Aurora v2 Plan claimed this was done, but validating if fully merged/tested.* Logic: Allow charging in "expensive" slots if the "cheap" window is physically too short to reach Target SoC.
*   **[Core] Sensor Unification**: Refactor `inputs.py` / `learning.py` to read *all* sensor IDs from `config.yaml` (`input_sensors`), removing the need for `secrets.yaml` to hold entity IDs.

### 🛠️ Ops & Infrastructure
*   **[Ops] Deployment**: Document/Script the transfer of `planner_learning.db` and models to production servers.
*   **[Ops] Error Handling**: Audit all API calls for graceful failure states (no infinite spinners).

## Future Ideas (Darkstar 3.x+?)
*   **Multi-Model Aurora**: Separate ML models for Season or Weekday/Weekend.
*   **Admin Tools:** Force Retrain button, Clear Learning Cache button.
