# Darkstar Energy Manager: Active Plan

**Vision: From Calculator to Agent**
Darkstar is transitioning from a deterministic optimizer (v1) to an intelligent energy agent (v2). It does not just optimize based on static config; it observes context (Weather, Vacation, Prices), predicts outcomes (Aurora ML), and actively strategizes (Strategy Engine) to maximize efficiency and comfort.
