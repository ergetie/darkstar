## 🤖 AI Instructions (Read First)

1.  **Naming:** Use generic names (e.g., `Settings Cleanup`, `Chart Improvements`) until the item is promoted.

2.  **Sections:**
    - **📥 Inbox** — New bugs/requests added by the user, unsorted. AI sorts items into the sections below when processing them.
    - **🐛 Fixes** — Broken or incorrect behavior in existing functionality.
    - **🔧 Improvements** — Existing functionality made better, faster, more honest, or more maintainable (incl. tech debt, tooling, tests).
    - **✨ New Features** — Net-new capability, including UI additions.
    - **💡 Future Ideas / Deferred** — Brainstorming, or explicitly considered-and-deferred items with revisit triggers.

3.  **Workflow rules:**
    - When an item is processed into an OpenSpec change, DELETE it from this file immediately at change-creation time (the change tracks it from then on).
    - Investigations happen BEFORE a change is created — changes contain only atomic, clear, pre-decided implementation tasks, never "investigate X" tasks.
    - Items tagged **(needs production data)** cannot be implemented cold — they require a data-review session with the user first.
    - Change verification MUST visually check every page whose SHARED code was touched (e.g. `lib/api.ts`, chart helpers), not just the pages the change is "about" — other users run different configs than the maintainer.

4.  **Format:** Use the template below for new items.

#### [UI] Expand Settings-Search User Guides

**Goal:** Grow the in-app guide library beyond the initial 4–5 guides shipped with the settings search.

**Notes:** The settings search (see the settings-search change, discussed 2026-07-18) launches with short guides for Load Balancing, EV Charging, Water Heater, Battery/S-Index, and Solar Forecast. Later, add guides for the remaining functions (e.g. price alerts, vacation mode, excess-PV priority, advisor/LLM, quick actions) and consider deepening existing ones. Revisit trigger: after the settings-search change ships and has been used for a while.
