## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Energy endpoints return source-attributed EV cost
`/api/energy/today` and `/api/energy/range` SHALL return `ev_grid_kwh`, `ev_solar_kwh`, `ev_cost_sek` and `ev_solar_share` for the period. They SHALL be computed per slot as defined by the `ev-cost-attribution` capability and summed from `slot_observations`. `ev_cost_sek` SHALL be the EV's grid import cost only and SHALL NOT exceed `import_cost_sek`.

The existing fields, including `ev_charging_kwh`, `import_cost_sek` and `net_cost_sek`, SHALL be unchanged. The zero-fallback response SHALL include the new fields, with 0 values and a null share.

#### Scenario: Fields present
- **WHEN** a client calls either endpoint for a period with EV charging
- **THEN** the response SHALL include the four EV cost fields
- **AND** `ev_grid_kwh + ev_solar_kwh` SHALL equal `ev_charging_kwh` within rounding

#### Scenario: Error fallback
- **WHEN** the aggregation fails and the zero fallback is returned
- **THEN** `ev_cost_sek` SHALL be 0 and `ev_solar_share` SHALL be null
